Big Data Mining with Spark

**Task 1:**
Naive Bayes algorithm
- Use the Naive Bayes algorithm as a means to automatically classify news reports. 
- Test the classifierâ€™s performance using different settings. 

**Task 2:**
Movie recommendation
- Use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as our choice of algorithm to build our recommender system.
- The recommender system relies on how often a song was played rather than the explicit rating provided by users.
- The dataset can be quite large, can cover more users/artists and contains richer information than a rating dataset.

**Task 3:**
MYSQL VS SPARK SQL
- compare performance of MYSQL and SPARK SQL (based on query executed time)
- compare the performance in various data scale (from 10M to 2G)
- query executed on database with huge records (from millions to billions of records)
