The dataset we will be using is distributed by last.fm in 2005 and can be found online as a compressed
archive at http://bit.ly/1KiJdOR. Download the archive and you will find several files. The main dataset
that we will be using is the user artist data.txt file. It has over 140,000 users, 1.5 million unique artists and
roughly 24 million users’ information about how often they played a given song/artist.
The dataset also gives the names of each artist by ID in the artist data.txt file. When the data was
recorded, the names of the artists could be misspelled or non-standard, and this can be detected only later.
For example, ‘The Smiths,’ ‘Smiths The’ and ‘he smiths’ may appear as distinct artist IDs, but they refer to
the same artist. So, the dataset also includes artist alias.txt dataset, which maps the artist IDs that are known
to be misspelled or variants to the canonical ID of the artist.
